       PORT=your_server_port

       DB_NAME=your_database_name
       DB_USER=your_database_user
       DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
       DB_DIALECT=mysql
       DB_HOST=localhost
   ```

   If database credentials are not provided, the following will be used

   ```
     PORT=3000

     DB_NAME=compasscar
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASSWORD=123
     DB_DIALECT=mysql
     DB_HOST=localhost
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   To make sure everything is running as expected, run the command
